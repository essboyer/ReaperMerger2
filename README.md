ReaperMerger2
=============
Reaper Merger - A tool for merging two or more Reaper DAW .rpp files. This is a WIP and DOES NOT YET WORK!

What is this?
--------------
Reaper Merger2 will be a PHP webservice that will parse and compare Reaper .rpp project files. There will be a frontend added (ReaperMerger) eventually, probably in C# or Java so it can be cross-platform.
